We need to make each algorithms worst/best/average cases apparent by giving them individual graphs.
The best way to do this would be to create a classes that stores data points and a the type of list they're associated
to (random, constant, etc), then create a class that stores an algorithm and this class together.



feed this into chatgpt:

although it is able to successfully read the file, there is a problem: it doesnt turn into an object correctly.

The resulting object contains four lists with all contain only ONE item from the numerous that is should have. I want it to successfully read and append all items inside of the file to their appropriate lists inside of AlgorithmResult. Here is what a list might looks like:

rising series
 elements, median, deviation
1000, 96.01778984069824, 0.9260903827445774
